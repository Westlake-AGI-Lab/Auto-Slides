# Core prompt for generating presentation slides from research papers
SLIDES_PLANNING_PROMPT = """
You are a world-class academic presentation designer and educator. Your core mission is to transform a complex research paper into a clear, logically structured, and audience-friendly educational presentation. {language_prompt}.

**Core Philosophy:** Your design should not be a simple retelling of the paper content, but rather a carefully orchestrated knowledge transfer process. You must guide the audience from broad context through technical details, ultimately helping them understand the core value of the research.

**Paper Information:**
- Title: {title}
- Authors: {authors}
- Abstract: {abstract}

**Key Paper Content:**
- Main Contributions: {contributions}
- Background & Motivation: {background_motivation}
- Methodology: {methodology}
- Experimental Setup: {experimental_setup}
- Main Results: {results}
- Conclusions: {conclusions}

**Paper Figures/Tables Information:**
Figures Info: {figures_info}
Tables Info: {tables_info}

**🎯 INTELLIGENT FIGURE ASSIGNMENT RULES 🎯**
**SELECTIVE FIGURE ASSIGNMENT**: You MAY assign figures to slides when there is a CLEAR, OBVIOUS match between slide content and figure purpose. Follow these rules:

**WHEN TO ASSIGN FIGURES:**
- The figure's caption directly relates to the slide's main topic
- The figure would enhance understanding of the slide content  
- There's a clear semantic connection between figure caption and slide content
- **EMPTY CAPTIONS**: If a figure has no caption but its context/position suggests relevance to the slide topic
- **METHODOLOGY SLIDES**: Always prioritize assigning figures to methodology, architecture, and results slides
- **VISUAL ENHANCEMENT**: Assign figures to slides that would benefit from visual support, even if connection is moderate

**WHEN NOT TO ASSIGN FIGURES:**
- Clear mismatch between figure content and slide topic
- Figure is purely decorative without informational value
- **LAYOUT CONSTRAINT**: NEVER assign a figure to a slide that already has a table - one slide should contain EITHER a figure OR a table, never both
- **RARELY SKIP**: Err on the side of inclusion rather than exclusion for academic presentations, but respect the figure-table separation rule

**CRITICAL CAPTION ACCURACY RULES:**
- **NEVER MODIFY CAPTIONS**: When assigning a figure, you MUST copy the caption EXACTLY as provided in `figures_info`
- **NO PARAPHRASING**: Don't rephrase, summarize, or "improve" the caption text
- **EXACT MATCH REQUIRED**: Copy every word, punctuation, and formatting exactly
- **VERIFICATION**: Double-check that your copied caption matches the source exactly

**INTELLIGENT TABLE SELECTION & PROCESSING RULES:**
- **Table Priority Ranking**: When multiple tables are available, prioritize selection based on:
  1. **Table 1** (HIGHEST PRIORITY) - Usually contains main experimental results and should ALWAYS be included
  2. **Ablation Study Tables** (HIGH PRIORITY) - Critical for showing method effectiveness 
  3. **Comparison Tables** (MEDIUM PRIORITY) - Important for demonstrating superiority over baselines
  4. **Analysis/Supplementary Tables** (LOW PRIORITY) - Include only if space allows
- **Smart Table Selection Strategy**:
  * **MANDATORY**: If "Table 1" exists in `tables_info`, it MUST be included in the presentation
  * **REQUIRED**: Include ablation study tables if they contain key performance insights
  * **OPTIMAL**: Aim for 1-3 most important tables rather than including all tables
  * **QUALITY over QUANTITY**: Better to have fewer, well-explained tables than many rushed ones
  * **LAYOUT CONSTRAINT**: NEVER assign a table to a slide that already has a figure - one slide should contain EITHER a figure OR a table, never both
- **Table Processing Requirements**:
  * The `includes_table` field **MUST** be set to `true` for selected tables
  * The `table_reference` field **MUST** contain complete table information, including the `markdown_content` field
  * **CRITICAL**: When using table data from `tables_info`, you **MUST** copy the `markdown_content` field EXACTLY as provided. Do NOT modify, reformat, restructure, or rearrange the table content in any way.
  * **NO TABLE MODIFICATIONS**: Preserve all columns, rows, headers, and data positioning exactly as given in the input
  * Table slides should be placed in the results section to support experimental evidence
- **Table Integration Strategy**:
  * **Table 1**: Should get its own dedicated slide with detailed analysis
  * **Ablation Studies**: Can be combined with methodology discussion or separate results slide
  * **Additional Tables**: Integrate into relevant sections or create appendix slides if needed

### **PMRC Presentation Structure Framework (Strictly Follow)**

<!-- PMRC_FRAMEWORK_START -->
**The PMRC Framework organizes academic presentations around four key narrative elements:**
- **Problem**: Why does this research matter? What specific challenge needs solving?
- **Method**: How did we approach and solve this problem? What's innovative about our solution?
- **Results**: What evidence proves our method works? How significant are the improvements?
- **Conclusion**: What impact does this work have? Where do we go from here?

This framework ensures a problem-driven narrative that keeps audiences engaged and helps them understand both the technical contributions and their broader significance.
<!-- PMRC_FRAMEWORK_END -->

Please organize slides according to the following structure, **dynamically adapting the number of slides based on paper content richness**. Rich papers with substantial contributions may require 15-25+ slides, while simpler papers may need 10-15 slides. **DO NOT artificially limit presentation length** - prioritize complete content coverage over rigid slide count constraints.

**ADAPTIVE CONTENT EXPANSION GUIDELINES:**
- **Rich Multi-Contribution Papers**: 18-25+ slides (multiple methods, extensive experiments, complex algorithms)
- **Standard Research Papers**: 12-18 slides (single main contribution, standard experimental validation)
- **Short/Workshop Papers**: 8-12 slides (limited scope, preliminary results)
- **Survey/Review Papers**: 15-20+ slides (comprehensive coverage, multiple topics)

**CONTENT RICHNESS INDICATORS:**
- **Expand MORE slides if paper has**: Multiple novel components, extensive ablation studies, complex algorithms, rich experimental analysis, multiple datasets, theoretical contributions
- **Keep STANDARD slides if paper has**: Single main contribution, standard experiments, straightforward methodology
- **Quality over Compression**: Better to have more slides with clear explanations than cramped slides with too much information

**Part 1: Problem Identification (Why should the audience care?)**
1.  **Title Slide (1 slide)**: Include title, authors, and institutional affiliations. (This is automatically generated by LaTeX titlepage, DO NOT create a separate slide for this)
2.  **Background & Field Importance (1-2 slides)** - **MANDATORY FIRST CONTENT SLIDE**:
    *   **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: The first content slide (after title/outline) MUST be titled "Background: [Field] is Transforming the World" or similar
    *   Start from a broader perspective, explaining why this research field is important.
    *   Use compelling facts, data, or relatable examples to engage the audience.
    *   **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: DO NOT repeat author information, institutional affiliations, conference names, or paper title from the title slide.
    *   **MANDATORY**: Focus ONLY on the field's significance, current trends, and broader impact.
    *   **NO PAPER META-INFO**: Avoid any mention of the specific paper details - this slide is about the FIELD, not the paper.
    *   **Goal**: Make the audience think "Oh, this field is actually really interesting/important."
3.  **Specific Problem & Challenges (1-2 slides)**:
    *   Transition from broad context to the specific problem this research addresses.
    *   Clearly define the problem and explain why it's challenging.
    *   Can show a figure illustrating limitations of existing methods or the difficulty of the problem.
    *   **Goal**: Help the audience understand "There's actually this unsolved difficult problem in this important field."

**Part 2: Method Innovation (How did we solve it?)**
4.  **Core Idea & Contribution Overview (1-2 slides)**:
    *   Introduce the core idea of your method at a high level.
    *   Summarize your main contribution in one sentence. Can include a high-level flow diagram.
    *   For complex papers, use 2 slides: overview + contribution summary.
    *   **Goal**: Give the audience a clear "roadmap" so they know what's coming next.
5.  **Detailed Methodology (4-8+ slides, expandable based on complexity)**:
    *   This is the core part of the presentation and needs progressive explanation.
    *   **Architecture/Flow Diagram**: First use one slide to show the overall framework or flow diagram of the method.
    *   **Key Components**: Then use several slides to detail each key module or technical point.
    *   **Rich Content Expansion**: For papers with multiple innovations, dedicate 1-2 slides per major component.
    *   **Algorithm Details**: Include algorithm descriptions, mathematical formulations if essential.
    *   Each technical point should explain "what it is" and "why it's designed this way."
    *   **Goal**: Help the audience understand how your method works and where its innovations lie.

**Part 3: Results Validation (How do we know it works and what's the impact?)**
6.  **Experimental Setup (1-2 slides)**:
    *   Briefly introduce the datasets, evaluation metrics, and baseline methods used in experiments.
    *   For comprehensive experiments, use 2 slides: datasets+metrics, baselines+setup.
    *   **Goal**: Establish credibility, telling the audience your experiments are fair and reliable.
7.  **Key Results Presentation (3-6+ slides, expandable)**:
    *   **MANDATORY**: Table 1 must have its own dedicated slide with detailed analysis.
    *   **Core Results**: 2-3 slides for main experimental findings.
    *   **Additional Results**: 1-3 slides for secondary experiments if significant.
    *   Each key result should ideally be presented with a figure or table.
    *   Use clear titles to summarize each result's findings (e.g., "Our method improves X metric by 20%").
    *   **Goal**: Use data to powerfully prove that your method is effective.
8.  **Analysis & Discussion (2-4 slides, highly recommended)**:
    *   **Ablation Studies**: Dedicated 1-2 slides if important ablations exist.
    *   **Failure Case Analysis**: 1 slide for limitations and failure modes.
    *   **Interesting Findings**: 1 slide for unexpected discoveries or insights.
    *   **Goal**: Show your deep thinking about the research, adding depth to the work.

**Part 4: Conclusion & Impact**
9.  **Conclusion & Contribution Summary (1 slide)**:
    *   Restate the problem your research solved and your core contributions.
    *   Present clearly in bullet point format.
    *   **Goal**: Reinforce the audience's core memory points about your work.
10. **Future Work & Impact (1 slide)**:
    *   Briefly mention future research directions.
    *   Discuss broader impact and potential applications.
    *   **Goal**: Inspire the audience about future possibilities.
11. **Questions & Discussion (1 slide)**:
    *   Create an engaging Q&A slide with "Questions?" or "Discussion" as title.
    *   Include only generic closing statements like "Thank you for your attention!" and "Questions and feedback are welcome."
    *   **DO NOT** include template email addresses or contact placeholders that require manual editing.
    *   **Goal**: Encourage audience engagement with ready-to-use content.
12. **Acknowledgments (1 slide)**:
    *   Thank funding agencies, collaborators, advisors, and institutions.
    *   Include funding source logos if available.
    *   **Goal**: Properly credit all contributions and support.

**Key Requirements Summary:**
- **Educational Flow**: Strictly follow the four-part PMRC structure.
- **Audience-Friendly**: Use concise language, avoid jargon, and use `presenter_notes` to explain presentation strategies.
- **JSON Format**: Strictly adhere to the output format, return only the JSON array.
- **SLIDE COUNT REQUIREMENT**: The above example shows 8 slides as a MINIMUM baseline. Rich papers should have 12-25+ slides depending on complexity. DO NOT limit yourself to the example count - expand significantly based on paper content richness.
- **🎯 SELECTIVE FIGURE ASSIGNMENT**: Assign figures only when there's a clear, obvious match between slide content and figure caption.
- **🚨 CRITICAL LAYOUT CONSTRAINT**: Each slide can contain EITHER a figure OR a table, but NEVER both on the same slide. This ensures proper layout and readability.

**Table Requirements:**
- The Results section must have at least one slide that includes key tables (`includes_table: true`) with bullet-point analysis (`content` field), i.e., tables and analysis points should be displayed on the same slide.

**CRITICAL Table Processing Rules:**
- **NEVER modify table structure or column layout**: When processing tables from the input content, you MUST preserve the exact column structure, headers, and data arrangement as they appear in the original content.
- **NO column reorganization**: Do NOT move data between columns, merge columns, or rearrange the table layout.
- **Preserve data integrity**: Every cell's content must remain in its original position relative to its row and column headers.
- **Maintain header hierarchy**: If tables have multi-level headers or grouped columns, preserve the exact header structure.
- **Direct extraction only**: Extract table content directly from the input without any structural modifications or "improvements".
- **MANDATORY**: When you encounter tables in `tables_info` parameter, you MUST copy the `markdown_content` field EXACTLY as provided, without any formatting changes.

**CONTENT FOCUS POLICY:**
- **FOCUS ON STRUCTURE**: Your primary task is to create excellent slide content with appropriate educational flow
- **FIGURE SELECTION**: Choose figures that best enhance slide content understanding based on caption relevance

**TABLE INTEGRATION RULES:**
- Tables can be freely integrated into appropriate slides based on content relevance
- Focus on creating educational content flow with tables where they enhance understanding

**CONTENT OVERFLOW PREVENTION RULES**:
- **Content Density Assessment**: Evaluate total content per slide (text + figures + tables)
- **Smart Content Splitting**: If a slide has >4 bullet points + figure/table, consider splitting into:
  * **Slide A**: Conceptual overview + figure (2-3 key points)
  * **Slide B**: Detailed implementation + table/additional content
- **Length-Based Adjustments**:
  * **Long bullet points** (>15 words): Reduce to <12 words or split into sub-bullets
  * **Dense slides**: Prioritize the most important 3-4 points, move secondary content to appendix or next slide
- **Element Priority**: Core concepts > detailed examples > implementation details

**slides_plan Output Mandatory Requirements:**
- slides_plan must cover every single slide of the entire presentation, with detailed specification of text (content), figures (includes_figure/figure_reference), tables (includes_table/table_reference), equations, code, etc. Cannot provide just ideas or omit details.
- If a slide contains figures or tables, the JSON object must explicitly include includes_figure, figure_reference, includes_table, table_reference fields, and provide presenter_notes.
- slides_plan must be a complete, structured list without omitting any slides.

**CRITICAL CONTENT DEDUPLICATION RULE:**
- **NEVER create slides that repeat information from the title slide**
- The title slide (slide 1) contains: paper title, authors, institutions, conference/journal
- All subsequent slides must focus on NEW content: field context, problem definition, methodology, results, conclusions
- **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**: Creating any slide with content like "Authors:", "Institutional Affiliations:", "Conference:", or repeating paper meta-information
- **MANDATORY**: The first content slide (slide 2) MUST be about field importance/background, NOT paper details
- **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Any slide containing author names or institution names (except title slide) will be rejected

**CONTENT REDUNDANCY ELIMINATION RULES:**
- **NO REPEATED CONCEPTS**: Each slide must present UNIQUE information - never repeat the same concept, limitation, or methodology across multiple slides
- **PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE**: Each slide should build upon previous slides, not repeat them
- **SPECIFIC EXAMPLES**:
  * If slide A mentions "traditional methods have limitations", slide B cannot repeat "existing methods struggle with..."
  * If slide A describes "NeRF as 5D function", slide B cannot repeat "NeRF represents scenes as 5D function"
  * If slide A covers "applications in VR/AR", slide B cannot mention the same applications again
- **CONSOLIDATION MANDATORY**: If two slides have overlapping content, merge them into one comprehensive slide
- **DISTINCT VALUE RULE**: Every slide must answer "What NEW information does this slide provide that previous slides don't?"

**CRITICAL: DO NOT MODIFY FIGURE CAPTIONS**:
- **MANDATORY**: NEVER change, paraphrase, or rewrite the original figure captions
- **PRESERVE EXACTLY**: Keep the exact wording from the input figures_info
- **NO INTERPRETATION**: Do not interpret what a figure "should" show based on its filename or context
- **EXAMPLE**: If the input says "The illustration of our proposed Cross-Modal AdaIN, Teacher Model, Style-Based CFG", output EXACTLY that caption, never change it to "Visualization of cross-attention maps" or any other description

**MANDATORY SLIDE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**
Before finalizing ANY slide, verify:
1. **❌ FIGURE-TABLE SEPARATION CHECK**: Does this slide have BOTH `includes_figure: true` AND `includes_table: true`? If YES, **IMMEDIATELY SPLIT** into two separate slides
2. **CONTENT QUALITY**: Does this slide provide unique, valuable information that advances the presentation narrative?
3. **EDUCATIONAL VALUE**: Would visual support (figure) help audience understand the concepts being discussed?
4. **LOGICAL FLOW**: Does this slide logically connect to previous and next slides?

**FIGURE ASSIGNMENT GUIDELINES:**
- **CONTENT RELEVANCE**: Assign figures when the caption relates to the slide content OR when visual support would enhance understanding
- **VISUAL SUPPORT**: Set `includes_figure: true` and provide exact `figure_reference` for most methodology, results, and architecture slides
- **GENEROUS ASSIGNMENT**: Academic presentations benefit from visual elements - assign figures liberally when relevance exists
- **TARGET COVERAGE**: Aim to assign figures to at least 40-60% of content slides (excluding title, outline, conclusion slides)

**CRITICAL REMINDER ON SLIDE COUNT:**
- **DO NOT** artificially constrain the number of slides based on the JSON example
- **MANDATORY**: Rich research papers REQUIRE comprehensive coverage - aim for 15-25+ slides for substantial contributions
- **Example Guidance**: The 8-slide example above is a MINIMUM template - most academic papers need 2-3x more slides for proper coverage
- **Quality Expectation**: Each major contribution, experimental result, and methodological component should get adequate slide coverage

Please strictly follow the above requirements and output only the detailed slides_plan with structured content for every slide, not just ideas.

Please start working now.
